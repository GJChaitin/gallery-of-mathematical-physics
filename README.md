In 1985, Greg Chaitin gave a course at IBM Research called "A Computer Gallery of Mathematical Physics". This consisted of a number of simulation programs that modeled an important equation in Physics.

The simulations were written in various programming languages like PL/I, Fortran, and APL/360, but the final version was written in APL2 in 1986, which was somewhat new at the time.

Here we attempt to collect the APL2 programs and variants (actually predecessors), of these programs.

Although I transcibed these to C to work on an IBM/PC, no longer have copies of what I wrote.
